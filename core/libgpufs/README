This is a GPUfs source code.

The code is quite far from being production quality, so it is provided as is, and presumably only for educational purposes.
Some notable limitations include the lack of proper error handling, and poor modularity when used in conjunction with the actual application code.
Future releases will contain, hopefully, a much more complete version with improved usability.


==============
COMPILATION

GPUfs requires NVIDIA CUDA 5.0 to be compiled.

1. Environment -- CUDA_ROOT is by default in /usr/local/cuda-5.0, and should be redefined otherwise
2. Compile the library with 
> make libgpufs.a
Debug version can be compiled with:
make dbg=1 libgpufsd.a

Make sure that you "make clean" before compiling

3. Compile the consistency lib user API in gpufs_con_lib.user directory
4. Compile any example in the samples directory


==============
USING GPUFS

In order to use gpufs, the best is to look at the examples in the samples directory.
Every sample has a "fs.cu" file which is the same across all samples, except for 2 lines of code: the one including 
#include "SAMPLE.CU"
and the kernel invocation name:
SAMPLE_KERNEL<<<>>>()

To compile a sample, run:
> make fs
and the resulting "fs" binary will be created.

Obviously this is a temporary hack to be used  until a more modularized way of working with GPUfs will be ready for distribution (in the workings now).

The compiled code was checked to be working correctly on both C2075 and K20.


==============
LIMITATIONS

The module that takes care of the buffer cache consistency across multiple GPUs and CPU is not provided because it is by far not ready for the prime time.
The interface API is required for compilation (gpufs_con_lib.user) but it is not used here.
